## Overview

This project simulates a software development team using AI agents. It defines roles like Project Manager, Software Architect, Senior Developers (Frontend and Backend), and a QA Engineer. The agents collaborate on tasks such as architecture planning, code development, testing, and communication (via simulated meetings).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.9+:**  Download and install Python from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   **pip:** Python's package installer.  Usually comes with Python.
*   **uvicorn:**  ASGI server for running the FastAPI application.
*   **FastAPI:** Web framework.
*   **CrewAI:**  For orchestrating the agents and tasks.
*   **Pydantic:**  For data validation and settings management.
*   **Access to an LLM API:**  You need an API key from a Large Language Model provider (e.g., Mistral AI, Google Gemini, OpenAI).  This project currently uses Mistral AI.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rg-incognito/CrewAi-Coder-Agent-Fast-API.git
    cd CrewAi-Coder-Agent-Fast-API
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    *   **On Windows:**

        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    *   **On macOS and Linux:**

        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```

4.  **Install the required packages:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    (If a `requirements.txt` file doesn't exist, create it with the following contents, or adapt as needed, based on the packages the script imports):

    ```
    fastapi
    uvicorn[standard]
    crewai
    pydantic
    ```

## Configuration

1.  **Set your LLM API key:**

    *   Export your Mistral AI API key (or other LLM provider's API key) as an environment variable:

        ```bash
        export MISTRAL_API_KEY="YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY"  # Replace with your actual API key
        ```

        (Or, for other LLM providers, set the appropriate environment variable, e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`)

2.  **(Optional) Configure Tools:**

    *   **Web Search Tool:** The `WebSearchTool` currently has a placeholder implementation.  To enable real web searching, you'll need to:

        *   Choose a web search API (e.g., Google Search API).
        *   Obtain an API key.
        *   Implement the `_run()` method of the `WebSearchTool` to use the API.

    *   **Meeting Tool:** The `MeetingTool` is a basic simulation. Consider integrating with a real meeting platform if you need more advanced functionality.

3.  **(Optional) Code Storage:**

    *   Decide where the code files generated by the `CodeWriterTool` should be stored. Ensure the script has write permissions to this directory.  The default is the current working directory.

## Running the Project

1.  **Start the FastAPI application:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

    (Replace `main` with the name of your Python file if it's different.)

2.  **Access the API:**

    *   The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Usage

The script exposes a single API endpoint:

*   **`POST /develop/`:**  Initiates the software development process.

    *   **Request Body (JSON):**

        ```json
        {
          "problem_statement": "Create a simple chat application with user authentication and message history."
        }
        ```

    *   **Response (JSON):**

        ```json
        {
          "message": "Software development initiated!",
          "result": "..."  // Details of the development process and outcomes from the agents
        }
        ```

    * Use a tool like `curl`, Postman, or Insomnia to send a POST request to this endpoint.  For example:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"problem_statement": "Create a to-do list application"}' http://localhost:8000/develop/
    ```

## Tools and Technologies

*   **CrewAI:** Orchestrates the AI agents and their tasks.
*   **FastAPI:** Provides the web API for interacting with the script.
*   **Pydantic:** Handles data validation and model definitions.
*   **LLM (Mistral AI, Gemini, OpenAI, etc.):**  Powers the AI agents.
*   **CodeWriterTool:** Writes code to files.
*   **CodeReaderTool:** Reads code from files.
*   **WebSearchTool:** Searches the web for code snippets, documentation, etc. (Placeholder - requires implementation).
*   **MeetingTool:** Simulates meetings between agents.

## Customization

*   **Agent Goals and Roles:**  Modify the `goal` and `role` attributes of the agent definitions to customize their behavior.
*   **Task Descriptions:**  Adjust the `description` of the tasks to provide more specific instructions to the agents.
*   **Tools:** Add or modify the tools available to the agents to extend their capabilities.
*   **LLM Selection:** Experiment with different LLMs to find the one that works best for your specific tasks.
*   **Meeting Frequency:** Adjust or add meeting tasks to change the frequency of meetings.
*   **Project Phases:** Add or remove tasks to represent different development phases.

## Troubleshooting

*   **API Key Errors:**  Ensure that your LLM API key is set correctly as an environment variable.
*   **Package Installation Issues:** Double-check that you have activated the virtual environment and that all required packages are installed.
*   **Web Search Errors:**  If you're using the placeholder `WebSearchTool`, you'll need to implement the actual web search functionality.
*   **File Permission Errors:**  Make sure the script has write permissions to the directory where it's storing code files.
*   **CrewAI Task Orchestration:** Check the verbosity to see details for what is the agent asking and executing for better clarity of the bug.

## Disclaimer

This script is a simulation and may not produce real-world software development results. The AI agents are not perfect and may make mistakes. Use this script for educational and experimental purposes only. Real APIs Keys may involve cost, be sure to check the terms of use before.
